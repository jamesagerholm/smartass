<div class="list">



<ul>
	<li>It's the 21st Century and the rules have changed when it comes to reading books.</li>
	<li>Paper is not needed anymore and although everyone likes the texture and security of paper books, they no longer need to spend so much time, money or space to buy and read them.
	</li>
	
	<li>In the new digital world e-books are booming and although it is sad that the book shops are fading away printing is extremely expensive and classic publishers no longer advertise for their new author's work so they get stuck in a rolling loop as no one knows about their books and therefore no one reads them.</li>


	<li>Smartass Publishers works in this new era and concentrates on editing and advertising for it's authors. We do not publish books on paper so we have a significantly lower publication costs thus we can turn a mean of 50% (minus the e-stores commission) of the price of the sold books back to their authors.</li>
	

	<li>If you consider to print on your own with us we will only take our percentage off the ebooks not the printed ones.</li>
	<li>We will have our client's on all the e-book stores and we are not allied to amazon.</li>
</ul>
